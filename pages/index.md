This GitHub Pages theme is designed to provide a **consistent, minimal, and professional identity** with its principles being:

- **No distractions**: The layout avoids unnecessary decoration, ensuring focus remains on the content.
- **Flat colours**: A modern palette that works well both digitally and in print.
- **Priority on dark mode**: Designed with accessibility and reduced eye strain in mind.

It has been developed to function reliably in a wide range of contexts, including:

- **Screens**: computers, tablets, phones, TVs, and projectors
- **Presentations**: clean and distraction-free for slides and talks
- **Printed paper**: crisp contrast for reports or handouts
- **Screen readers**: semantic HTML and accessible design choices
